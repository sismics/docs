First off, clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/sismics/docs.git`
or download the sources from GitHub.

#### Launch the build

From the root directory:

    mvn clean -DskipTests install

#### Run a stand-alone version

From the `docs-web` directory:

    mvn jetty:run

#### Build a .war to deploy to your servlet container

From the `docs-web` directory:

    mvn -Pprod -DskipTests clean install

You will get your deployable WAR in the `docs-web/target` directory.
