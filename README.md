Install with Docker
-------------------

A preconfigured Docker image is available, including OCR and media conversion tools, listening on port 8080. The database is an embedded H2 database but PostgreSQL is also supported for more performance.

**The default admin password is "admin". Don't forget to change it before going to production.**
- Master branch, can be unstable. Not recommended for production use: `sismics/docs:latest`
- Latest stable version: `sismics/docs:v1.7`

The data directory is `/data`. Don't forget to mount a volume on it.
> Note: Because the docker container uses the jetty user 100(uid):101(gid), you need to make sure the permissions for the data directory are set correctly:
> chown -R 100:101 <your_data_dir>

To build external URL, the server is expecting a `DOCS_BASE_URL` environment variable (for example https://teedy.mycompany.com)

Manual installation
-------------------

#### Requirements
- Java 8 with the [Java Cryptography Extension](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
- Tesseract 3 or 4 for OCR
- ffmpeg for video thumbnails
- mediainfo for video metadata extraction
- A webapp server like [Jetty](http://eclipse.org/jetty/) or [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)

#### Download
The latest release is downloadable here: <https://github.com/sismics/docs/releases> in WAR format. 
**The default admin password is "admin". Don't forget to change it before going to production.**

How to build Teedy from the sources
----------------------------------

Prerequisites: JDK 8 with JCE, Maven 3, Tesseract 3 or 4

Teedy is organized in several Maven modules:

  - docs-core
  - docs-web
  - docs-web-common

First off, clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/sismics/docs.git`
or download the sources from GitHub.

#### Launch the build

From the root directory:

    mvn clean -DskipTests install

#### Run a stand-alone version

From the `docs-web` directory:

    mvn jetty:run

#### Build a .war to deploy to your servlet container

From the `docs-web` directory:

    mvn -Pprod -DskipTests clean install

You will get your deployable WAR in the `docs-web/target` directory.
