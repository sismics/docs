Install with Docker
-------------------

A preconfigured Docker image is available, including OCR and media conversion tools, listening on port 8080. The database is an embedded H2 database but PostgreSQL is also supported for more performance.

**The default admin password is "admin". Don't forget to change it before going to production.**

- Master branch, can be unstable. Not recommended for production use: `sismics/docs:latest`
- Latest stable version: `sismics/docs:v1.8`

The data directory is `/data`. Don't forget to mount a volume on it.

To build external URL, the server is expecting a `DOCS_BASE_URL` environment variable (for example https://teedy.mycompany.com)

### Available environment variables

- General
  - `DOCS_BASE_URL`: The base url used by the application. Generated url's will be using this as base.
  - `DOCS_GLOBAL_QUOTA`: Defines the default quota applying to all users.
  - `DOCS_BCRYPT_WORK`: Defines the work factor which is used for password hashing. The default is `10`. This value may be `4...31` including `4` and `31`. The specified value will be used for all new users and users changing their password. Be aware that setting this factor to high can heavily impact login and user creation performance.

- Admin
  - `DOCS_ADMIN_EMAIL_INIT`: Defines the e-mail-address the admin user should have upon initialization.
  - `DOCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD_INIT`: Defines the password the admin user should have upon initialization.  Needs to be a bcrypt hash.  **Be aware that `$` within the hash have to be escaped with a second `$`.**

- Database
  - `DATABASE_URL`: The jdbc connection string to be used by `hibernate`.
  - `DATABASE_USER`: The user which should be used for the database connection.
  - `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: The password to be used for the database connection.

- Language
  - `DOCS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`: The language which will be used as default. Currently supported values are:
    - `eng`, `fra`, `ita`, `deu`, `spa`, `por`, `pol`, `rus`, `ukr`, `ara`, `hin`, `chi_sim`, `chi_tra`, `jpn`, `tha`, `kor`, `nld`, `tur`, `heb`, `hun`, `fin`, `swe`, `lav`, `dan`

- E-Mail
  - `DOCS_SMTP_HOSTNAME`: Hostname of the SMTP-Server to be used by Teedy.
  - `DOCS_SMTP_PORT`: The port which should be used.
  - `DOCS_SMTP_USERNAME`: The username to be used.
  - `DOCS_SMTP_PASSWORD`: The password to be used.

### Examples

In the following examples some passwords are exposed in cleartext. This was done in order to keep the examples simple. We strongly encourage you to use variables with an `.env` file or other means to securely store your passwords.

#### Using the internal database

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
# Teedy Application
  teedy-server:
    image: sismics/docs:v1.8
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      # Map internal port to host
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      # Base url to be used
      DOCS_BASE_URL: "https://docs.example.com"
      # Set the admin email
      DOCS_ADMIN_EMAIL_INIT: "admin@example.com"
      # Set the admin password (in this example: "superSecure")
      DOCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD_INIT: "$$2a$$05$$PcMNUbJvsk7QHFSfEIDaIOjk1VI9/E7IPjTKx.jkjPxkx2EOKSoPS"
    volumes:
      - ./docs/data:/data
```

#### Using PostgreSQL

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
# Teedy Application
  teedy-server:
    image: sismics/docs:v1.8
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      # Map internal port to host
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      # Base url to be used
      DOCS_BASE_URL: "https://docs.example.com"
      # Set the admin email
      DOCS_ADMIN_EMAIL_INIT: "admin@example.com"
      # Set the admin password (in this example: "superSecure")
      DOCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD_INIT: "$$2a$$05$$PcMNUbJvsk7QHFSfEIDaIOjk1VI9/E7IPjTKx.jkjPxkx2EOKSoPS"
      # Setup the database connection. "teedy-db" is the hostname
      # and "teedy" is the name of the database the application
      # will connect to.
      DATABASE_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://teedy-db:5432/teedy"
      DATABASE_USER: "teedy_db_user"
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: "teedy_db_password"
    volumes:
      - ./docs/data:/data
    networks:
      - docker-internal
      - internet
    depends_on:
      - teedy-db

# DB for Teedy
  teedy-db:
    image: postgres:13.1-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - 5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: "teedy_db_user"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "teedy_db_password"
      POSTGRES_DB: "teedy"
    volumes:
      - ./docs/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - docker-internal

networks:
  # Network without internet access. The db does not need
  # access to the host network.
  docker-internal:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true
  internet:
    driver: bridge
```

Manual installation
-------------------

#### Requirements

- Java 8 with the [Java Cryptography Extension](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
- Tesseract 3 or 4 for OCR
- ffmpeg for video thumbnails
- mediainfo for video metadata extraction
- A webapp server like [Jetty](http://eclipse.org/jetty/) or [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)

#### Download

The latest release is downloadable here: <https://github.com/sismics/docs/releases> in WAR format. 
**The default admin password is "admin". Don't forget to change it before going to production.**

How to build Teedy from the sources
----------------------------------

Prerequisites: JDK 8 with JCE, Maven 3, NPM, Grunt, Tesseract 3 or 4

Teedy is organized in several Maven modules:

- docs-core
- docs-web
- docs-web-common

First off, clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/sismics/docs.git`
or download the sources from GitHub.

#### Launch the build

From the root directory:

    mvn clean -DskipTests install

#### Run a stand-alone version

From the `docs-web` directory:

    mvn jetty:run

#### Build a .war to deploy to your servlet container

From the `docs-web` directory:

    mvn -Pprod -DskipTests clean install

You will get your deployable WAR in the `docs-web/target` directory.
